# Pascal's Triangle
The challenge in this task is to develop a python program that displays the Pascal's triangle of n.
The program has a function that accepts the size of the triangle to be printed and returns an empty
list if n <=0 otherwise list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of n. the value
of 'n' is assumed always to be an integer.
